# firebaseproj

This a simple "firebase database" project that adds and deletes contacts based on their phone numbers and names.

When the user adds a contact and gives the phone number and name this contact is saved in the firebase database and then it is read to be added in the list of contacts using Stream Builder.

When the user deletes a contact it's also deleted from the firebase database and the List is updated immediately.

This Project uses the following skills:
-Flutter
-Dart
-Front-End Implementation
-Stateful Widgets
-Stream Builder
-Firebase Database
